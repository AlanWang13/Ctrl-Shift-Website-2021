       <div class="left_col"><h1>Depression Story</h1>
        <p>After my mom got us away from my abusive dad, she started struggling herself but never dealt with her issues. Instead she started drinking and taking pills. Everything caused her to lash out and a little thing I would do as a kid (like break a glass or cry for over spilt milk) would set her off. As I grew up it only got worse and worse and worse, from yelling and mental to physical- it doesn't mean she didn't have amazing mom moments, and I'm so grateful she got us away from my dad (although sometimes I wish she would have sooner). I always tried to pay her back and show her my love though, I knew she was struggling and I had a sense of what struggling was like. But my mental health was not up to par because of everything. It didn't help that she would fill my head with "your problems are just kid problems, my problems are real adult problems", "I'm more stressed/depressed (list of everything she is going through)", even my trips to mental hospitals and residentials she was telling me how much I was making her suffer through this. And I started getting angry and "selfish" but then she got diagnosed with cancer and I hated myself more. She survived without any chemo, just takes the pills. But now, I'm finally trying to cut her out of my life.... the guilt kills me. I really love her but she only makes me worse. She feeds into my cognitive distortions and calls me crazy for going to the mental hospital or therapy when I'm just trying not to kill myself because I see some sort of potential in me. She also gets crazier and crazier and I just can't stand it.
        I'm not allowed back home but I don't have a "permanent" address because the apartment complex I live at doesn't have mail boxes or mailing room, so I only have a po box. I have no choice (unless someone can help with ideas) but to put her address as my permanent. So all my mail and yes my stimmy checks go to her place. I'm basically
        </p>
      </div>
        <div class="right_col">
          forced to visit her and hear the guilt tripping.  Everytime I cry in the car because she makes me feel bad for existing. I was the reason why my dad started getting violent, I was the reason she had to leave, I am the reason she doesn't want to live, and I will never be as good as her. Everytime. I want it to stop. I am trying so hard to be my own person- I pay for my car in cash right off the lot, insurance, rent, phone, everything. But this emotional Rollercoaster is plating a part in me failing college. I'm on my second year and failing still, covid definitely didn't help. It sucks because I know I'm smart but I'm unmotivated because I feel so helpless. I'm trying, I promise. I'm trying as hard as I can and am can't help but to cry because of the pain I experience while having internal battles with myself to just survive a day or try to figure out what emotion I'm feeling.
        My mom went through a lot too and I know deep down instead she's not a bad mom because I cherish her good moments- so am I a horrible daughter for not dealing with her? She is my only parent afterall. Am I just a failure of a person because I can't deal with what life handed me? Will this pain ever feel slightly better? Will I ever just be better? Allow myself to have a good education, get a good job, and live a happy life. I'm not asking for a 6 figure salary, a million dollar car/house.. I just want to be a little comfortable. I just want to be a little happy.

        <p>I am eighteen years old, mexican-american girl, currently residing in Mexico. I want to share my story.</p>
        <p>My father was born in New York, 1969, son of a very wealthy couple. He attended a prestigious journalism college and on 1994 he came to Mexico, where he met my mother. Ever since I was a little girl, I saw my father leave without further notice. I always felt alienated from him, even though he always showed how much he loved me (when he could) I didn't got to know him very well. He was tall, blonde, with lovely blue eyes, such a handsome man. He is gone now. When I was a little girl, I never noticed what was going on behind the scenes. As I have grown up, I have learned to know all about his life. Or so i thought.</p>
        <p>My father was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia around 2012. I obviously wasn't aware since I was only eleven at that time, and my wonderful parents kept everything from me, to keep me safe. I don't remember much of those years, though I started noticing that something was off. I was told that one night during 2012, my father, in the middle of the night, got up to grab all of the food in the fridge and threw it away. He did this because he thought that the food and water were poisoned. This is my earliest memory from his psychosis. His illness took over him, to a point in which he didn't knew the difference between reality and hallucinations.</p>
        <p>He was never aware about his illness. I thank to God every night that he didn't do anything at all to hurt my mother and I, in fact, he died for our safety. His hallucinations began telling him, around 2012, that my mom and I were going to get kidnaped and r*ped by the US Government and their</p>
        </div>
        <div class="right_col">
          <p>
          intelligence agencies. He thought that he was being controlled by the US Government through mind control. He thought that his mother, my mother and I were all going to be shot and killed at any moment. He also feared for his life. He was completely delusional, he couldn't live a normal life or work anymore in the successful business that he founded and left for me to run someday. His life was hell. He got in trouble with Mexican authorities and went to jail for one year in the US. He was on probation when he escaped the US to visit my mother and I on 2017, which was the last time I ever saw him.
          </p>
          <p>
            In October 2017, he committed suicide, he couldn't handle it anymore.
            Today, July 27th 2020, I found a book that he wrote. A book about his illness, and how he perceived it. How it tortured him. In this book, I came to find out that he hallucinated about people following him, torturing him and telling him that he was part of the CIA. I also came to find out that he had attempted suicide multiple times during my childhood, and so many other things that I wasn't aware of. He was constantly being told that my mother and I were going to get killed, and the only way to avoid this was by killing himself. He didn't achieve to do so until October 2017. I feel heartbroken for what I read. My father was such an intelligent, loving man, and I never got to say goodbye. I never even saw him get buried, since he died in Holland. It's almost been three years and there are so many things about him and his sickness that I still don't know about. I wish I could've done something to help him.</p>

        <div class="left_col"><h1>Anxiety Story
        </h1>
        
        <p>So about a year ago, I recently learned, just like the majority of people, that I suffer from anxiety...almost, every single day I go through the same emotional notions e.g. there's too many customers coming into work, i don't have enough time to clean, do this and do that, I'm running around like an idiot, my ideas aren't being appreciated by my managers at work, i don't think I'm fit for the job...I'm working way too many hours, I come home and all i want to do is hide because the influx of customers is over whelming.
        </p>
 
        <p>So, I have a ton of insecurities about myself, last year in September I wanted to kick anxiety to the curve by putting my hand up and became team leader of a Boost Juice, Juice and Smoothie bar. I got the position, was happy with myself but every single day I still go through the same, repetitive mindset...
        </p>
        <p> I'm so over it, I'm not lying in bed upset thinking I can't do my job as team leader. My work colleagues take forever to complete online training, my approach to leadership is to be nice, supportive and encouraging but perhaps they're just taking the piss out of me.
        I genuinely think I'm just not good at my job. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="right_col">

       <p>I don't know how to naturally curve myself of these negative thoughts all the time. I even get upset over things like an email wasn't responded too immediately so therefore they're ignoring me...are they though? Or are they just busy doing other things?
      </p>

      <p>Why not just not care about the end result of things and get over it? Why can't I just go to work, do my job and come home? Why do I have to over analyse every single thing that happens in a course of a working day and pin it down to...I'm just bad at my job...I feel like crying.

        <p>My apologies for the long post. Please don't respond if you have something negative to say or something that may make me feel worse. I'm not in a good headspace...</p>

        <p>What the hell is so entertaining about fireworks? For those of us that were nearly killed by real life fireworks it brings a rush of mixed emotion. Anger, adrenaline that can't be turned off and doesn't go away, flashback to combat, embarrassment, sadness, panic, helplessness, back to anger - all while irrational behavior makes everyone look at you like you're crazy. I feel crazy.</p>

        <p>Our humvee was hit by an IED 12/30/05 and I've struggled every single day since. It's like the previous me died that night and a shell of my former self replaced myself in that instance. Never been the same since... I especially struggle leading up to 12/30 and thereafter. I don't really know how to change my outlook about 12/30 and the IED/firefight I was injured in. Had a concussion and TBI from it and came to in the middle of a firefight where strykers had our back.</p>

        <p>I live in the middle of nowhere in the mountains and the ridge I look up at from my house, about a mile away, is a gated community with $1M+ homes. They had huge fireworks last night that went on forever. I'm doing my best to keep it together before that happened, I freaked out last night and a lot of my anger has shifted to some sort of desperate sadness. I just feel like fing crying. It caught me off guard and it was ridiculously intense.</p>
        
        </div>
        <div class="right_col">
          <p>I wish the damn things were illegal. Do a light show with drones - those are cool. To glorify mortars, rockets and combat is terrible for society in general as it glorifies war for entertainment value and is inconsiderate at the very least to those that struggle from combat ptsd. It's not like we can get away from what they are forcing us to endure. Actual lives are affected and lost in combat and it's very bad to desensitize people to death and combat for entertainment purposes. It devalues life. It's a kick in the crotch to some veterans, not to mention the affect it has on pets and wildlife in the area. I just don't get the appeal of it. Boom, lights = oooohs & ahhhhs... WTF All I think about is taking out the threat and when I get pissed that I can't fight back, I head to the bunker in the basement upset and shaking. I think about a buddy we lost in a vbied and another that was paralyzed in another incident with an IED. I know I have issues and can't expect everyone to always accommodate me. It just seems like this pointless ritual does more harm than good and I don't think anybody even cares that it has an extremely detrimental affect on some people and animals.</p>

          <p>Sorry to rant about this, I imagine most of you here don't feel the same way. I'm sure some can relate though. I don't know how to deal with ptsd symptoms other than avoidance of triggers. It's easy to avoid crowded places and certain other situations. I feel safe in my house 99% of the time but you can't avoid fireworks like this and I don't feel safe at the moment in my own house. It just sucks and I'm really tired of feeling like this. It doesn't get better over time, only worse. I'm exhausted and sometimes I wish I had died in that IED. Sometimes that voice in the back of my head gets loud and it's hard to distinguish between what are real thoughts vs intrusive. I thought I had the anniversary under control this year until last night. Now I'm in a deep dark hole and nobody understands.</p>

        <p>disclaimer : this post is going to be all over the place, i don't even know why i'm writing it or what i want to say. i guess i just wanna dump my thoughts lmao sorry in advance I've (21F) always had a really unhealthy relationship with food but it's been getting worse lately. I either completely stop eating and survive on a couple of coffees a day, or I eat big portions all throughout the day (even when i'm not hungry).</p>

        <p>Last year, when covid first started and my country went through its first lockdown, I was going through one of the worst periods of my life. I was suicidal and could barely do anything. Naturally, I wasn't eating at all. I live in a muslim country though, and it coincided with ramadan (fasting month), so my family wasn't really worried. I was also working on my capstone and could only work with a nocturnal sleeping schedule, so they just assumed I was eating when they were asleep. I was also obsessively working out. I lost xx kgs during that period and i've never gotten so many compliments. Neighbors i've never spoken to and distant acquaintances were telling me how better I looked after losing the weight.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="right_col">
          
        <p>I happily took the compliments and ignored the fact that not eating messed up my body and my physical and mental health. Fast forward a couple of months, I'm done with my capstone, I'm doing a master's and I'm heavily stressed. I stopped working out. I kept the weight for a bit, and I stupidly thought "maybe my metabolism is working great now". But the more stressed I got, the more I ate, and the more weight I gained.</p>

        <p>I started to hide food in my closet and binge eat it in hiding and then cry afterwards (this is one of those instances rn). It is now a year later after i lost the weight and I gained more than half of it back. I've never hated my body more. And I have no one to talk to about it. Every single one of my friends (even my boyfriend) is skinny. I have a best friend with whom I had shared my struggles last year, but I can't bring myself to talk to her about this right now. I know she would never judge me but I'm so terrified of her thinking that i'm a disgusting pig that i would just rather her think that i'm still starving myself. </p> 

        <p>Ramadan is in 2 weeks and all i can think about is "maybe I can get back on track !! maybe i'll be able to lose that weight again!!" (disclaimer : pls no one make any comments about how this month is not about weight loss. i know. leave me be.). I made an appointment with a psycho-nutritionist to help me lose weight in a "healthy way" (???), but it's not until mid-may, i don't know what to do til then. idk what i'm expecting from this post, i'm just in a really bad place rn idk. </p>
